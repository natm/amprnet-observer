# AMPRnet Observations

This tool examines AMPRnet prefixes in the global BGP routing table and in the AMPRnet portal.

I have seen a few AMPRnet prefixes "in the wild" which have not been assigned in the portal, I wondered how many more of these existed.




### Global routing table

- Num prefixes

- Num origin ASNs

- Prefixes with more than one origin

- Prefixes with matching portal assignment

- Prefixes with no matching portal assignment

### In the portal

- Num assignments of /24 or larger
